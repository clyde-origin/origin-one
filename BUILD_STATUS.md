# Back to One — Build Status
Update this file at the end of every Claude Code session. This is the single source of truth for where the build actually is.

Last updated: April 24, 2026 (post PR #7 merge, start of sequence-to-Auth push)

---

## Current Focus

**Anchor:** The resolve to complete the project effectively and efficiently. No fixed calendar date for Auth or first dogfood. Each feature lands as a complete arc (schema PR → UI PR → merge) before the next begins. Main green at every stop.

**Phase 1A milestone hit Apr 26, 2026** — Crew Timecards (Apr 23), Script drag-reorder (Apr 26, PRs #30 + #36), and FAB safe-area resolution via ActionBar replacement (Apr 25–26, PRs #26 / #27 / #28 + follow-ups) all landed.

**Cleanup bundle still open** (does not gate the next track): richer timecard seed (#2), role toggle on login (#3), CrewPanel extraction (#4), polish bundle (#5).

**Next, in sequence:** Location cleanup → Location parent/child UI → Storage discipline PR → Location images → Department enum conversion → PropSourced schema → PropSourced UI → WardrobeSourced schema → WardrobeSourced UI → InventoryItem schema → Inventory page → Inventory hub preview → Crew Profile v2 schema → avatars bucket → Crew Profile v2 UI → Auth.

**Dogfood trigger:** Tyler + Kelly run the app when every surface is honest and the data is real enough to think with.

## Recent — Apr 23 night session (four PRs shipped)

| PR | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| #4 — 0_init migration baseline tracked | ✅ Merged | Fresh-clone blocker cleared. Single-file, single-commit PR. |
| #5 — CrewTimecard schema + TimecardStatus enum | ✅ Merged | Caught `Location_entityId_idx` drift during `--create-only` migration; removed stray DROP INDEX from PR. Drift folded into Location cleanup PR (#8). |
| #6 — CrewTimecard seed (35 entries, 6 projects) | ✅ Merged | Caught ProjectMember-vs-User identity question at design time. Includes reopened case with full lifecycle trace. |
| #7 — CrewTimecard UI full feature | ✅ Merged | Three commits: affordances + Producer Overview + Individual Week View with log/submit/approve/reopen. Viewer shim in place pending Auth. CrewPanel.tsx at 1335 lines — extraction queued. |

Main at `c5e9e3e`. Crew Timecards complete end-to-end. Phase 1A is 2 features from milestone.

## Sequence to Auth

Each row is a complete PR (schema or UI). Strict order — next row doesn't start until previous is merged.

### Cleanup bundle

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Doc sync — BUILD_STATUS, CLAUDE files, MOVIELABS_ALIGNMENT | 🟡 In flight | Four files, one commit |
| 2 | Richer timecard seed (~200+ rows, varied states) | ⬜ | Replaces current 35-entry seed |
| 3 | Role toggle Producer ⇄ Crew on login page | ⬜ | Pre-Auth testing affordance |
| 4 | CrewPanel.tsx extraction | ⬜ | Pure refactor — split timecards sub-components to `components/hub/timecards/` |
| 5 | Polish bundle — background glow + Action items panel height | ⬜ | Single PR |

### Phase 1A close

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | Script drag-reorder | ✅ | Shotlist mode reorder shipped via PRs #30 (dnd-kit mechanics) + #36 (toast / rollback / cross-scene confirm). Script-mode drag not added — separate feature if needed. Shot-number mutability locked in DECISIONS.md (Apr 26). |
| 7 | FAB safe-area-inset rollout | ✅ | Resolved via ActionBar replacement (PRs #26 / #27 / #28 and follow-ups). Legacy FAB removed; ActionBar handles `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` on every surface. |
| — | **Phase 1A milestone marker** | ✅ | **Hit Apr 26, 2026** — both #6 and #7 landed. |

## Decisions locked on upcoming PRs

These decisions were made during planning and should carry into the PR work. Reference here so Claude Code prompts don't re-open settled questions.

**PropSourced / WardrobeSourced:**
- 1:1 FK to Entity (not 1:many). Pickup-options pattern (child table like `PropSourceOption`) added later only if a real production surfaces the need. Follows Location precedent.
- Lift-and-break migration: existing `Entity.metadata.status` values on props migrate into typed `PropStatus` enum column on PropSourced. The `metadata.status` read path in the Art page is dropped in the UI PR. `metadata.imageUrl` and `metadata.tags` remain on Entity unless explicitly lifted.
- Wardrobe status enum is distinct from Prop status — don't reuse.

**InventoryItem:**
- `ImportSource` enum limited to `manual`, `pdf`, `excel`. The `api` value is dropped as premature optionality — add later when a real integration ships.
- No role-gating UI placeholder. Auth renders real enforcement or nothing renders.

**Crew Profile v2:**
- `phone`, `avatarUrl` on User (global, doesn't change by project).
- `notes`, `skills` on ProjectMember (project-scoped, can vary per production).
- Role dropdown uses existing `Role` enum — UI change only.
- Avatar upload depends on `avatars` bucket + helper (shipped in immediate preceding PR).

**Storage buckets:**
- New buckets (`locations`, `avatars`) ship their setup SQL in Prisma migrations, not manual scripts.
- All new buckets ship with `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` RLS from day one.
- Existing permissive `moodboard` / `storyboard` policies are a known open door — tightened on Auth day along with table RLS.

## Known Issues / Cleanup Queue

Organized by severity. Non-blocking unless noted.

### Drift and data

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **`Location_entityId_idx` drift** | Index exists in live DB, not declared in `schema.prisma`. Surfaced via `--create-only` during Timecards schema PR. Folded into Location cleanup PR (sequence #8). |
| P2 + P4 unpaired `Entity(type='location')` rows | 5 rows without paired Location records. Folded into Location cleanup PR (#8). |
| `approved` Boolean on Location | Audit for redundancy with LocationStatus enum. Folded into Location cleanup PR (#8). Kept separate today (aesthetic sign-off vs. booking — distinct concerns). |
| Storyboard bucket setup not committed | App code references `storyboard` bucket but the setup SQL isn't in repo. Folded into Storage discipline PR (#10). |

### Code structure and quality

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **CrewPanel.tsx extraction** | File grew to 1335 lines during Timecards UI build. Extract timecards sub-components to `components/hub/timecards/` (ProducerOverview, IndividualWeekView, shared WeekNavBar/StatusPill/week math). Pure refactor, no behavior change. Cleanup bundle (#4). |
| BRAND_TOKENS.md full migration to Tailwind config | Currently tokens are documented but not wired into Tailwind config. Every new component uses inline hex. When this migrates, the inline-hex pattern becomes a find-and-replace. |
| **HubContent assignee lookup id-vs-userId mismatch** | `apps/back-to-one/src/components/hub/HubContent.tsx:488,868` — assignee resolution compares `ProjectMember.id` to `User.id` (should compare `ProjectMember.userId` to `User.id`, or otherwise reconcile the two id spaces). Latent — surfaces when a User holds multiple ProjectMember rows on one project under distinct roles. Audit-flagged in the multi-role ProjectMember work (now landed on main); deferred to its own follow-up PR. |
| **`scenemaker/page.tsx` file size** | 2002 lines after PRs #30 + #36 — owns ShotlistView, StoryboardView, BoardCard, VersionHistoryPanel, the page component, and all reorder + persist + toast wiring. Mirror the CrewPanel.tsx extraction pattern: split into `apps/back-to-one/src/app/projects/[projectId]/scenemaker/components/` (ShotlistView, StoryboardView, SortableShotRow, SceneHeaderDroppable, EmptySceneDropZone — ScriptView already lives there). Pure refactor, no behavior change. Queue alongside the CrewPanel extraction. |

### Demo and testing

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Richer timecard seed** | Current 35 entries too sparse for realistic demo — fills only one slice of one week on most projects. Replace with ~200+ rows distributed across eligible crew × shoot days per project. Cleanup bundle (#2). |
| **Role toggle Producer ⇄ Crew on login page** | Pre-Auth testing affordance so crew mode is actually testable. Cleanup bundle (#3). |
| Talent seeded as ProjectMember in `Other` dept | 11 talent rows parked in `Other` department. Eventually moves to dedicated Talent table. When that ships, the timecards eligibility rule simplifies from `!IN ('Client','Other')` to `!= 'Client'`. |

### Timecards follow-ups (from PR #7 Apr 23)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Viewer-identity shim → Auth session | Single-spot `useMemo` in CrewPanel. Swapped in Auth PR (#25). |
| Reopener/approver name attribution | Currently falls back to "Producer" label. Pass `allCrew` down to resolve real names. Cosmetic. |
| Split-day entries multi-card variant | Schema allows multiple entries per (crew, day). UI currently shows only first. Add multi-card variant if seed or user input creates split-days. |
| Optimistic updates on approve/reopen/submit | Current pattern is invalidate-on-success. Codebase-wide pattern (not yet established). |
| EntryEditor description length validation | Client-side limit on description. Non-urgent. |

### Architectural threads for future

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Formotion appeared in build graph Apr 23 night | Supposed to be parked pending brand architecture conversation. Appears in `pnpm -w build` output. Confirm whether it should stay in active build set or get extracted. |
| `markThreadRead` firing frequency check | Needs audit — may be over-firing. |
| milestone ThreadRowBadge offset on thin rows | Visual tweak, noted Apr 23. |
| **OMC vocabulary alignment pass** | DECISIONS.md and schema comments should use Movielabs OMC v2.8 terminology (Narrative/Production, Depiction/Portrayal) to make the architecture legible to industry audience. Small doc PR after dogfooding. |

### Deferred until after dogfooding

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Folder structure in project selection | Not painful at 6 projects. Build when real pain surfaces. |
| Long-press drag-reorder as universal pattern | Build once as shared primitive; apply per-surface. Don't scatter per-feature implementations. |
| Location parent/child deeper semantics | Current model is 1:many Entity→Location. Questions like geographic containment (Vineyard → Barrel Room) are separate from narrative→production pairing. Revisit post-dogfooding if real productions surface the need. |
| Props / Wardrobe pickup-options child tables | If a real production needs multiple sourcing records per scripted prop/wardrobe, add `PropSourceOption` / `WardrobeSourceOption` as child tables under the 1:1 PropSourced / WardrobeSourced. |
| Camera Metadata per shot (OMC/SMPTE RIS OSVP) | Long-term interop concern. Ships when post workflow requires it. |
| OMC-aligned RDF/JSON-LD schema publication | Interop publication for Movielabs community. Long-term. |
| Rate-unit semantics + math | Current schema has `rate Decimal(8,2)` with no unit field. UI hardcodes "/day" label and computes `total = hours × rate`, which produces incorrect totals for day-rate roles (e.g. 6 hours × $900/day = $5,400, should be $900). Hourly-rate roles like editors aren't representable. Proper fix is `rateUnit` enum (`'day' \| 'hour'`) plus unit-aware math, landing alongside budget functionality where rate-unit will have a proper consumer. Until then, the math in EntryCard subtext and ProducerOverview totals is cosmetically wrong but not structurally wrong — no real money flows through the demo. Do not "fix" the math in isolation — wait for the budget feature work. |

## Operational Notes

- **Prisma generate before seed** after every schema change — `pnpm --filter @origin-one/db prisma generate`. Skipping this wiped the DB mid-seed Apr 19.
- **Supabase connection:** session pooler port 5432 for both DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL. Username `postgres.sgnjlzcffaptwzxtbefp`. Host `aws-0-us-west-2.pooler.supabase.com`. Transaction pooler (6543) on same host refuses this username format.
- **Prisma is canonical** — all schema changes via `prisma migrate dev` → commit → deploy. No direct Supabase Studio edits.
- **Storage is canonical too** — bucket and RLS SQL lives in Prisma migrations, not `scripts/setup-storage.sql`. Storage discipline PR (#10) brings existing moodboard setup into alignment.
- **Schema changes require dedicated PRs.** Never ride on feature branches. Schema PR → `prisma generate` → seed update if needed → all-three-apps compile → UI PR → merge. Then next feature.
- **`git fetch origin` before any branch-pointer operation** referencing remote tracking refs. `origin/main` is a cached pointer that only updates on fetch.

## Phase 1 Complete Milestone

A full Origin Point production — pre through post — runs entirely inside Back to One.

**External beta begins only after:** every feature in the sequence above ships + Auth lands + Tyler/Kelly dogfood session informs any final adjustments.

---

## Movielabs / OMC alignment

The narrative→production split at the core of Back to One's schema (Entity → Cast/Location/PropSourced/WardrobeSourced) mirrors Movielabs OMC v2.8's Narrative/Production element distinction with Portrayal (for Characters) and Depiction (for objects/places).

Planned conversation with Chris Vienneau at Movielabs after first dogfood — see `MOVIELABS_ALIGNMENT.md` for the schema-mapping document prepared for that conversation. Target outcome: feedback on our alignment, discussion of potential 2030 Greenlight / implementer case study fit, and guidance on controlled vocabulary sync.

Do not let OMC alignment drive speculative schema work. The discipline remains: if a real production needs it, model it. OMC vocabulary alignment is for documentation legibility, not schema expansion.
